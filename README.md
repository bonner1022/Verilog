# Verilog Projects

## Full Adder
This repository shows a project where we used Verilog to design hardware components. The first component that we design is a simple full adder, that handles binary addition of 1 bit. The adder will take in 3 inputs: the bits that we are adding(_a, b_) and also a carryin(_cin_) bit. It will have 2 outputs: the sum of addition(_sum_) and also a carryout bit(_cout_). According to binary addition, the carryout bit is activated if 2 bits equal to 1. This simple solution can be expanded to apply to an adder capable of handling multiple bits. The solution for this adder is shown in the figure named **_FullAdder_**. We will also add a testbench and simulation results to verify the logic.
